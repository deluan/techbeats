# Experience

## ThoughtWorks    March/2012 – Present

I'm currently working for ThoughtWorks, Inc as a Lead Consultant. I have been involved in software architecture/design, mentoring/coaching, enterprise application development, automation and deployment, and project coordination with distributed teams. Here are the most representative projects I worked on:

- Client: Southwest Airlines (since December/2013)

Enterprise DevOps (EDO) project is aimed at automating infrastructure at Southwest. Currently, when a new project starts, the ramp up time for assigning infrastructure, installing tools like Atlassian Jira, Confluence, Crowd, Stash and Jenkins takes between 1-2 months. The aim of the EDO project is to automate the entire process so that when a project is kicked off, it takes no more than a day, which involves submitting a request. Besides just having applications up, it requires them to be updated, configured and connected, since not all of these tools can exist in isolation. Southwest will use this automated process to pilot a couple of projects and then will be used for existing and new projects.

Technologies used: Chef, Ruby, Amazon Web Services, RESTful services, Java 7, Jenkins, Gradle, Git

- Client: Natural Market Food Group – Toronto, ON, Canada (June/2013 – November/2013)

I worked with a distributed ThoughtWorks team to develop a Rails back-end API, an AngularJS web ordering application. The back-end integrates with different point of sales systems, CMS, mobile apps and in-store kiosk. It features major integration, search, and visual design challenges, and make extensive use of Web 2.0 technologies.

Technologies used: Ruby on Rails, RESTful services, AngularJS, Android, NodeJS, Java 7, CSS3, HTML5, Go Continuous Delivery, Git

- Client: The GAP (April/2012 – March/2013) 

Starting April 2012, I joined the retailer's team in Brazil, on a project that had the goal to implement faceted navigation (filters by color, price, brand, etc…) and keyword search on the GAP's ecommerce sites, using Apache Solr. The first part of the project, faceted navigation, was a huge success, with a positive impact on the company's revenue and great appraisal from its customers. After that, the focus of the project shifted to leverage Solr's features to implement keyword search in English and French, fine-tuning the language analysis algorithms and configuration to meet customers expectations.

Technologies used: Java 6, Spring, Spring MVC, Apache Solr, Hadoop, HBase, JMeter, Oracle, Ruby, Cucumber, Sinatra, Git

## ANBIMA - Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association    June/2011 – March/2012

I worked as a Senior Java Developer in the team responsible for SELIC, the Special System of Clearance and Custody. SELIC is the Brazilian Central Bank's system for performing open market operations in execution of monetary policy. My main duties were:

- Mentoring the Java team, showing them best practices and helping in the design and implementation of software solutions.
- Migrate the current development environment from CVS/Ant to IBM's Rational Team Concert (RTC) and Maven.
- Introduce continuous integration to the team, using Jenkins. During this work, I developed a plugin to integrate RTC with Jenkins (https://github.com/jenkinsci/rtc-plugin), which was released as Open Source and has since been installed more than 170 times (as of Jan/2013).

Technologies used: Java 6, JavaEE, JSF, EJB, JMS, JPA, Maven, JMeter, Sonar, Jenkins, Nexus

## Averone Tecnologia Ltda    2002 – 2008

I founded this company, focusing on the development of custom, high technology software projects. In its 6 years of existence, I've designed and developed complete solutions for Java EE, mobile platforms, client/server platforms and embedded systems. Besides running the company, I also played a key role in the technical team, being responsible for:

It was developed for IBOPE, the biggest media and market research company in Latin America.
