I've decided to write a series of posts detailing the architecture and implementation
of a personal project I'm working on, and show some of the pitfalls I've fallen into.

1. Introduction
2. Architecture
3. WebServices in GoLang
4. GoLang and ng-admin
5. JWT Authentication
6. Deploying to Heroku
7. Continuous Delivery with GitLab and Heroku
6. Webpack
